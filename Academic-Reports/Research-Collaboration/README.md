# Smart City Critical Infrastructure Research

## Project Overview

**Course**: VU23217 & BSBINS401 - Cyber Security in an Organisation  
**Assessment**: Research Report and Presentation (Part 3)  
**Topic**: Hacking of Smart City Critical Infrastructure  
**Collaboration**: Joint project with [Kelly Lindsay](https://github.com/KellyLindsayCodes)  
**Date**: September 2024

## Assessment Requirements

This project required selecting a cybersecurity research topic and delivering both a comprehensive written report and presentation. The assessment criteria included:
