## Project Overview

**Course**: VU23220 - Develop and carry out a cyber security industry project  
**Assessment**: Part B - Red Team Penetration Testing (Individual Activity)  
**Target**: VulnHub Basic Pentesting 1 Virtual Machine  
**Completion Date**: June 2025  
**Assessment Type**: Individual practical penetration testing exercise

## Assessment Requirements

This assessment required conducting a comprehensive penetration test against a deliberately vulnerable server to demonstrate practical offensive security skills:

### Objectives
- **Root Access**: Achieve complete system compromise with root privileges
- **Admin Access**: Demonstrate administrative-level system control
- **Professional Reporting**: Document all activities using industry-standard penetration testing report template
- **Evidence Collection**: Include screenshots with student identification for verification

### Technical Setup
- **Isolated Environment**: Separate virtual environment from other coursework
- **Target System**: [VulnHub Basic Pentesting 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/basic-pentesting-1,216/)
- **Testing Approach**: Black-box penetration testing with no prior system knowledge

## Methodology and Approach

### Testing Phases Executed
1. **Host Discovery**: Network reconnaissance to identify live targets
2. **Service Enumeration**: Comprehensive port scanning and service identification
3. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Research and identification of exploitable weaknesses
4. **Exploitation**: Active exploitation of discovered vulnerabilities
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Achievement of root-level system access
6. **Documentation**: Professional reporting of findings and methodology

### Key Technical Findings

#### Network Discovery
- Successfully identified target system at 192.168.50.128
- Confirmed network connectivity and responsiveness

#### Service Enumeration
- **FTP Service (Port 21)**: ProFTPD 1.3.3c - Critical backdoor vulnerability
- **SSH Service (Port 22)**: OpenSSH 7.2p2 - Multiple known CVEs
- **HTTP Service (Port 80)**: Apache 2.4.18 - Web application vulnerabilities

#### Critical Vulnerability Exploitation
- **ProFTPD 1.3.3c Backdoor**: CVE-2011-2523 - Immediate root access achieved
- **Exploitation Result**: Complete system compromise with uid=0 privileges
- **Impact**: Total administrative control over target system

## Tools and Technologies Used

### Reconnaissance Tools
- **Netdiscover**: ARP-based network discovery
- **Nmap**: Comprehensive port scanning and service enumeration
